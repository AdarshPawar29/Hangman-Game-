**Accuracy**

Write a script that gives each word listed in words.txt file as input to above probram and prints the prediction accuracy.

Note : Comment the part of the code that prints board at every level, instead for each word just print if it correctly guessed the word or not.

Eg: CORRECT_GUESSES / TOTAL_WORDS * 100 --> 78% 


**CorrectGuess:  10 out of total words**
Total Accuracy:  0.22 %
